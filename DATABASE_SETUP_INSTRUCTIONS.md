# üöÄ Apply Database Schema to Fix Profile Image Upload

## Issue Identified
‚úÖ Google OAuth authentication is working  
‚úÖ User is successfully logged in  
‚ùå `profiles` table missing from database (causing 404 errors)

## Quick Fix: Apply Database Schema

### Step 1: Open Supabase SQL Editor
1. Go to your [Supabase Dashboard](https://supabase.com/dashboard)
2. Select your project: `zmyxqkjafhercgnjwrgk`
3. Click **SQL Editor** in the left sidebar
4. Click **New Query**

### Step 2: Copy and Execute Schema
1. Open the `supabase-schema.sql` file in your project
2. Copy the ENTIRE contents of the file
3. Paste it into the SQL Editor in Supabase
4. Click **Run** (bottom right)

### Step 3: Verify Schema Applied
After running the schema, you should see:
- ‚úÖ Tables created successfully
- ‚úÖ Triggers and functions created  
- ‚úÖ Row Level Security policies applied

### Step 4: Test Profile Upload
1. Refresh your application
2. Go to Settings ‚Üí Edit Profile
3. Upload a profile image
4. Click Save Changes
5. ‚úÖ Should work without 404 errors!

## What the Schema Does

**Creates Essential Tables:**
- `profiles` - User profile data (extends auth.users)
- `api_keys` - Encrypted API key storage
- `user_subscriptions` - Subscription management
- `usage_transactions` - Usage tracking
- `token_balances` - Token balance tracking

**Automatic User Setup:**
- When you signed up, it should have created a profile automatically
- If it didn't, the schema includes a trigger to handle future signups

**Security:**
- Row Level Security (RLS) ensures users can only access their own data
- Proper policies for profile, API keys, and usage data

## Troubleshooting

### If Schema Application Fails:
1. **Permission Error**: Make sure you're the owner of the Supabase project
2. **Extension Error**: Some extensions might already exist (ignore those errors)
3. **Constraint Error**: If profiles already exist, some commands might fail (that's OK)

### If Profile Still Doesn't Work:
1. Check if your user profile exists:
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM profiles WHERE id = 'b186848e-b38c-4368-974f-58fa411b2caf';
   ```

2. If no profile exists, create one manually:
   ```sql
   INSERT INTO profiles (id, email, display_name)
   VALUES ('b186848e-b38c-4368-974f-58fa411b2caf', 'jreinecke1@gmail.com', 'John Reinecke');
   ```

## Expected Result
After applying the schema:
- ‚úÖ Profile image upload will work
- ‚úÖ Image will appear in both Settings and header
- ‚úÖ All profile data will be saved properly
- ‚úÖ Ready for production use!

Your profile image upload functionality is already perfectly implemented - it just needs the database structure to save the data! üöÄ
